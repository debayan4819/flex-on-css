The main differences between the CSS Flexbox and Grid layout models are:

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, meaning it can manage either a row or a column at a time. It’s great for aligning content within a container and can handle dynamic or unknown sizes of elements.
CSS Grid is engineered for two-dimensional layouts, capable of handling both rows and columns simultaneously. It’s ideal for creating complex page layouts and placing elements precisely within a grid structure.
When to choose one over the other depends on the specific needs of your project:

Use Flexbox when you’re dealing with a simpler, linear layout, or when you need to align items within a container and want the layout to respond to the content size.
Opt for CSS Grid when you have a more complex layout that requires precise placement of elements in two dimensions, like a magazine or portfolio layout.
Both have their strengths, and sometimes they can be used together to achieve the desired layout. Flexbox can manage the content within a single axis very well, while Grid can create an overall structure with rows and columns
